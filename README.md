# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
This project analyzes New York Citi Bike data, using data visualization tools to explore the customers' habits and study if that type of business could work in other cities.

## Resources
•	Data Source:  
•	Software: Python, Anaconda Navigator, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau Public 

## Results

We studied in this project New York Citi Bike data for August 2019, and here are some findings:

### Story 1 (Dashboard)

[link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/grorge.alein/viz/Citibike_CH/Story1?publish=yes)

•	The total number of rides in the study is over 2.34 million.
•	81% of the users were subscribers.
•	65% of the users were confirmed males, and 25% were confirmed females
•	The peak hours are from 4-7 PM and 8 to 9 AM, and we can consider it as an indicator that many people might be using bikes to commute to work.
•	Based on the average trip duration, we can see that younger users tend to use the service for longer rides.

Story 2 (Dashboard)

We can see that most rides are happening in Manhattan, where the most touristic and busy areas are.
Story 3 (workbook)
We can see that the number of trips kept increasing for the 1 hour trip duration until it reached the peak at 5 hours trip duration, then the number of rides started to decline from there for higher trip durations.
Story 4 (Workbook)
We can notice here that the duration of trips of the Males last approximately 2 to 3 times the duration of the Females

Story 5 (Dashboard)
By looking at this dashboard, we can see that the trips are significantly between 7 AM and 9 PM and between 5 PM and 7 PM from Monday to Friday. That guides us to conclude that most users during workdays are workers who commute to work using bikes.

Story 6 (Workbook)
By looking at this chart, we notice that our hypothesis that most of the users during workdays are workers is likely to be true because most users are subscribers.
We also can tell that more males use bikes than females.

#Summary
The data shows the high activity of the bike-sharing service in New York during August 2019.
Most of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours while workers were heading to their jobs. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.
We Have to consider comparing data for different months and include weather data in the study to determine trends across the year, due to the effect that weather might have on the volume of the rides for the rest of the year.
